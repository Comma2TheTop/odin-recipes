    <h2>Description</h2>
    A flat white is an espresso-based coffee drink that originated in Australia
    and New Zealand. It’s made with a shot (or double shot) of espresso topped
    with steamed milk that has a velvety, microfoam texture. Unlike a latte,
    which has more milk and froth, the flat white has a stronger coffee flavor
    and a smooth, creamy mouthfeel, with just a thin layer of foam on top.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1–2 shots of espresso</li>
      <li>4–6 ounces steamed whole milk</li>
      <li>Thin layer of microfoam (from the steamed milk)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Brew 1–2 shots of espresso and pour them into a cup.</li>
      <li>
        Steam the milk until it is hot and has a smooth, velvety microfoam
        texture (not too frothy).
      </li>
      <li>Gently swirl the milk to keep the texture even.</li>
      <li>
        Pour the steamed milk over the espresso, holding back most of the foam.
      </li>
      <li>Finish with a very thin layer of microfoam on top.</li>
      <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
