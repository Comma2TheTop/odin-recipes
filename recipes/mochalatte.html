    <h2>Description</h2>
    A mocha latte is a delicious coffee drink that combines the bold flavor of
    espresso with the creaminess of steamed milk and the sweetness of chocolate.
    Often topped with whipped cream and sometimes dusted with cocoa powder, it’s
    a cozy balance of rich coffee and dessert-like indulgence
