    <h2>Description</h2>
    A pumpkin spice latte is a cozy, seasonal espresso-based drink that combines
    rich coffee with steamed milk, pumpkin purée, warm autumn spices (like
    cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves), and a touch of sweetness. It’s typically
    topped with whipped cream and a sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice, making it a
    comforting and festive beverage that’s especially popular during the fall.
